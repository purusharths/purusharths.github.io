# [agv] Introduction to Optimal Transport and Applications

This winter semester I will be giving a lecture along with Nikolai KÃ¶hler on Optimal Transport and Applications. 

This would be an introductory course. 

I will talk about Monge and Kantorovich formulation, Gradient Flows in Hilbert and Wasserstein spaces, Monge-Ampere Equations, Dynamical formulation of Optimal Transport (Bernamou-Brenier) and Trajectory Inference. 
It is also planned to talk about different flavors of Optimal Transport including Weak Optimal Transport, Martingale OT, and Causal OT.
