For the [FOSSEE Animations](https://math.animations.fossee.in) project we have shortlisted 10 students who will be creating a lecture notes and their corrosponding animations.
The syllabus for the said lecture-notes will be loosely based off from IIT Bombay's first year math syllabus.<br> 
I will be mentoring the shortlisted students along with [Sharanya Acut](https://github.com/sh-ac).

I will post further updates towards the end of the fellowship.
