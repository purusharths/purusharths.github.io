I am a PhD student at [Universit√§t Heidelberg](https://uni-heidelberg.de) in the [Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing](https://typo.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/home). I did my master's in Scientific Computing (Heidelberg) and my research interests include mathematical modeling with partial differential equations, uncertainty quantification, and numerical mathematics. In the second & third quarters of 2024, I received a scholarship to work with Optimal Experimental Design and Monte Carlo at [OvGU](https://www.ovgu.de/). My current PhD project is focused on developing mathematical models using Optimal Transport and Causal Inference methods for single-cell data at the [Velten Lab](https://velten-group.org).

Beyond the usual, I like logistical networks and cartography. Though it changes with time, I often unwind with cooking and board games. On the weekends I usually go for gravel riding.
