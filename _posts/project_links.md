Some Projects that were done 

Masters thesis code:
Python Paraview Visualizations: 


- **GRAF++**: A header only library used for generation of Gaussian Random Fields via circulant embeddings. Built on top of xetnsor and uses fftw3 backend.
@TODO add Karhunen-Lourve expansion to incorporate PDE Constraint Bayesian Inverse Problems <br>

- **Computational Molecular Biology**: Electrostatic Calculations with Adaptive poission boltzman solver (APBS) on Ubiqutin (1UBQ refined at 1.8 Angstroms Resolution)[8] and its complex with a SH3 Domain - the 2K6D
Molecule.

- **PDE Based Sampling**:
  Simple illustration of Sampling via SPDEs based on [Khristenko et.al, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07570.pdf), [Lindgren et. al, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x). <br>
  In a nutshell,


Basically, here the link link between the inverse $C^{-1}$ (inv. of covariance operator) and stochastic PDEs is utilized.<br/>
For example, Matérn fields can be sampled by solving the sPDE:
    
$$(\kappa^{2}-\Delta)^{\beta}a(x,\omega)=^{d}\mathcal{W}(x,\omega) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^d,$$

    
where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian and $\mathcal{W}$ is Gaussian white noise on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The resulting RF a is Gaussian with Matérn covariance with parameters
