I work on mathematics and computer science. At the moment I am working in IIT-B at the FOSSEE Project. We've start a cool new project called FOSSEE Animations
and we're creating a library of lecture notes and there animations on math.animations.fossee.in. 
A lot of stuff is being developed and vetted internally, and will be up on the website soon.

#### Internships
We give out internships on math.animations.fossee.in on various math topics. Quite recently, we finished one on **Real Analysis** and we have one scheduled for Complex Analysis/Mathematical Physics.
If you want to know more about them, please take a look at the website or drop me an [mail](/contact/) requesting slack invite.
Also, the registrations for the **FOSSEE Summer Fellowship**, at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, has started. I will be looking over _Mathematics using Python_ there.
