I"‰<p>I work on mathematics and computer science. At the moment I am working in IIT-B at the FOSSEE Project. Weâ€™ve start a cool new project called FOSSEE Animations
and weâ€™re creating a library of lecture notes and there animations on math.animations.fossee.in. 
A lot of stuff is being developed and vetted internally, and will be up on the website soon.</p>

<h4 id="internships">Internships</h4>
<p>We give out internships on math.animations.fossee.in on various math topics. Quite recently, we finished one on <strong>Real Analysis</strong> and we have one scheduled for Complex Analysis.
If you want to know more about them, please take a look at the website or drop me an mail requesting slack invite.
Also, the registrations for the <strong>fossee summer fellowship</strong>, at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, has started. I will be looking over <em>Mathematics and Python</em> there.</p>
