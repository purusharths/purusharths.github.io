I"ƒ<p>I got a spare system during the last days 2018 and decided to try my hands at it. The process was, suprisingly, not as complicated as one would expect. Infact it was quite straightforward. The initially housekeeping steps were a bit discouraging but once the user and group for <code class="highlighter-rouge">lfs</code> were set up, it was pretty much smooth sailing from there.</p>
