<p>After reciving feedback from numerous students and profs, we realized that it was about time to change the format for contribution on animations.fossee.in. After much discussion we, we started working on the creation of math.animations.fossee.in. More on this below:</p>

<h3 id="previous-contribution-format">Previous Contribution format</h3>
<p>Earlier the contribution cycle involved submission of a single animation video / visualization along with description. The problem with this was that the visualization was the primary foucs, and the description was not given the due importance. Overall, the mentors had to give repeated feedback and there had to be multiple revisions for the visualization from the contributor. Seggeregating the contribution was also an issue.</p>

<h3 id="new-contribution-format">New Contribution format</h3>
<p>The new contribution format is based on internships. These <em>remote internships</em> are in-turn, based on specific topics (for instance Real Analysis, Vector Analysis etc.). The process is much more stremalined.</p>
