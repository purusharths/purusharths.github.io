I"ï<p>There are great many tutorials out there for packaging. The RPM docs are meticuliously written covering all the details and error logs. I‚Äôm using this blogpost as my own personal scratchpad which I can rerfer to whenever needed.</p>

<h3 id="cmake-installations">CMake Installations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Check in the build logs if the flags set in the CMake file are present in <code class="highlighter-rouge">rpm -E %{optflags}</code>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS -fexceptions 
-fstack-protector-strong -grecord-gcc-switches -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1 -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/
redhat-annobin-cc1 -m64 -mtune=generic -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -fstack-clash-protection -fcf-protection
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>these are the flags that Fedora sets for packages, and <em>only</em> these must be set</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Check where in the CMakeLists.txt files upstream had hardcoded their flags: <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_compiler_flags">Fedora Default Compiler Flags</a></p>

<p>PS: it isn‚Äôt forbidden to use other flags, but unless there‚Äôs a very good reason to do so, we stick to these. If for some reasons upstream package is not compiling without the hard-coded flags, we‚Äôd have to work with upstream to see why removing their flags breaks the compilation; and, if necessary we add them to the default set.
However, the default flags are general enough and rarely cause such issues</p>

<ul>
  <li>About ‚Äúbuild‚Äù tools <br />
There are many different ‚Äúbuild‚Äù tools, <code class="highlighter-rouge">configure</code> is only used for ‚ÄúAutotools‚Äù. 
A <code class="highlighter-rouge">CMakeLists.txt</code> uses the cmake system. Make changes in %build as per the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmake</code> guideline page</li>
</ul>

<p>When you‚Äôre in the build directory, you‚Äôll have to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">%cmake ..</code> Eg:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>%install
	pushd build
		%cmake ..
		%make_install
	popd build
</code></pre></div></div>

<FranciscoD> the .a file is a static library---we avoid those

	set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}" CACHE PATH "Default install path" FORCE) is present in CMAKELists.txt by default. my path removed the line. So this patch can be removed?

	Yes, this one cannot find header files. However, for the successful builds in noarch, i686, and x86_64 all files were present.

<FranciscoD> There isn't a specific line, one has to read the file, search for general "tokens"

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:57]
<FranciscoD> FLAGS/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS is a good place to start

CMakeList files are unique for each project. They'll use cmake directives, but apart from that they're like code


oh, and pager does it too: https://pagure.io/tpcclib/blob/ankurs-fixes/f/0001-Disable-additional-compiler-flags.patch#_14

" # "install" README and COPYING files to be included in the binary package" I thought these files are supposed to be kept seprately?

Purusharth S, [05.05.20 21:09]
Do-not-install-docs-to-libdir.patch

they detect a 32 bit compiler, they set the -msse2 flag
"For the x86-32 compiler, you must use -march=cpu-type, -msse or -msse2 switches to enable SSE extensions and make this option effective. For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default."

now, -msse2 is *not* a valid option for arm: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 21:20]
<FranciscoD> So, when upstream set -msse2 for *all* 32bit systems, they broke the 32bit arm builds

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 21:20]
<FranciscoD> So, this particular flag also had to be removed

rpm -E %cmake`, you'll see that the macro defines the standard library path for us in LIB_INSTALL_DIR, so simpler to just use that
