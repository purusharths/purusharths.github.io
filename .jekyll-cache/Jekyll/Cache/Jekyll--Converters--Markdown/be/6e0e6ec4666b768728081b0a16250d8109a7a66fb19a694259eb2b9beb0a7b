<FranciscoD> there are many different "build" tools

Join Fedora BOT, [26.02.20 21:28]
<FranciscoD> configure is only used for "Autotools"

Join Fedora BOT, [26.02.20 21:28]
<FranciscoD> this has a CMakeLists.txt file, so it uses the cmake system

Join Fedora BOT, [26.02.20 21:29]
<FranciscoD> you make changes in %build as the cmake guideline page says

	when you're in the build directory, you'll have to use `%cmake ..`

<FranciscoD> the .a file is a static library---we avoid those

	set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}" CACHE PATH "Default install path" FORCE) is present in CMAKELists.txt by default. my path removed the line. So this patch can be removed?

	Yes, this one cannot find header files. However, for the successful builds in noarch, i686, and x86_64 all files were present.

To disable certain compiler flags:
Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:53]
<FranciscoD> I was looking at the build logs, and I noticed some flags which are not in %{optflags} that we set for our builds

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:53]
<FranciscoD> Try: `rpm -E %{optflags}` in a terminal

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:54]
<FranciscoD> these are 0the flags that Fedora sets for packages, and *only* these must be set

 I looked to see where in the CMakeLists.txt files upstream had hard coded their flags
 https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_compiler_flags

Well, it isn't forbidden to use other flags, but unless there's a very good reason to do so, we stick to these

But what if upstream, in this case tpcclib, has put up some more flags - and removing them would hamper the compilation?

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:56]
<FranciscoD> Then we'd have to work with upstream to see why removing their flags breaks the compilation

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:56]
<FranciscoD> and if necessary, we add them to the default set
	The default flags are general enough and rarely cause such issues

	Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:57]
<FranciscoD> There isn't a specific line, one has to read the file, search for general "tokens"

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 20:57]
<FranciscoD> FLAGS/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS is a good place to start

CMakeList files are unique for each project. They'll use cmake directives, but apart from that they're like code


oh, and pager does it too: https://pagure.io/tpcclib/blob/ankurs-fixes/f/0001-Disable-additional-compiler-flags.patch#_14

Purusharth S, [05.05.20 21:08]
" # "install" README and COPYING files to be included in the binary package" I thought these files are supposed to be kept seprately?

Purusharth S, [05.05.20 21:09]
Do-not-install-docs-to-libdir.patch

they detect a 32 bit compiler, they set the -msse2 flag
"For the x86-32 compiler, you must use -march=cpu-type, -msse or -msse2 switches to enable SSE extensions and make this option effective. For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default."

now, -msse2 is *not* a valid option for arm: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 21:20]
<FranciscoD> So, when upstream set -msse2 for *all* 32bit systems, they broke the 32bit arm builds

Join Fedora BOT, [05.05.20 21:20]
<FranciscoD> So, this particular flag also had to be removed

rpm -E %cmake`, you'll see that the macro defines the standard library path for us in LIB_INSTALL_DIR, so simpler to just use that
