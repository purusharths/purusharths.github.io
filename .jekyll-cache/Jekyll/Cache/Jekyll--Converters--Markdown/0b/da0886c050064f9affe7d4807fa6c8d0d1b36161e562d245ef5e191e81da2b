I"µ<p>Apologies for the misleading title, itâ€™s not really a saga for Asia/Kolkata. I just wondered why, even to this day, the Indian timezone is recognized by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Asia/Kolkata</code>, even after Kolkata lost its status as the most populus or important city of India (thereâ€™s no official benchmark for the latter, but with a bold claim we can say that if such a title exist it should go to either BOM, BLR, DEL, HYD, or MAA).</p>

<p>And as I looked into it, I found some interesting facts about IST (Full Disclosure: Citation Needed).</p>

<p>Long before IST, there was:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Time Zone</th>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <th>Abandoned in</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Calcutta Time</td>
      <td>UTC +5:53</td>
      <td>1948</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Madras Time</td>
      <td>UTC +5:21</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bombay Time</td>
      <td>UTC +4:51</td>
      <td>1955</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Madras Time was also called Railway time of India and of all the three, it was the closest to the current IST.</p>

<p>Calcutta was teh administrative captial of inda</p>
