I"Ì<p>Apologies for the misleading title, itâ€™s not really a saga for Asia/Kolkata. I just wondered why, even to this day, the Indian timezone is recognized by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Asia/Kolkata</code>, even after Kolkata lost its status as the most populous or important city of India (thereâ€™s no official benchmark for the latter, but with a bold claim we can say that if such a title exists it should go to either BOM, BLR, DEL, HYD, or MAA).</p>
