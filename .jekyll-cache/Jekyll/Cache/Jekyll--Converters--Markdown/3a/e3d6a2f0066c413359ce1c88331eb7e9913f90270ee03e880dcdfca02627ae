I"Ù<p>I work on math and computer science (and sometime write about them too). My most recent work is happening at FOSSEE, IIT-B at math.animations.fossee.in. A lot of stuff is being
developed and vetted internally, and will be up on the website soon.</p>

<h2 id="internships">Internships</h2>
<p>We do give out internship on math.animations.fossee.in on different subjects. Quite recently, we finished one on Real Analysis and we have once scheduled for Complex Analysis.
If you want to know more about them, please take a look at the website or drop me an email requesting slack invite.
Also, the registrations for the fossee summer fellowship 2020 have started. I will be looking over <em>Mathematics and Python</em> there.</p>
